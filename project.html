                Outside class project <br>
            </project>
            <detail>This project was a simple one I did on my own outside off class. It was written in phython. I was just fooling around creating a shoot em up game using pygame. The game essentially has the player moving left and right using the arrow keys and space to shoot incoming objects that would randomly spawn.<br></detail>

            <project> outside class project 2 <br></project>
            <detail>In this other project, I attempted to create a tactics RPG game in python. The player would have a cast of characters to choose from and be able to level up characetristcs of them like strength foir damage or consitution for health. It would take place in fantasy world and would be a sort of sword and sorcery game.  It was a very ambitious project, but it did not really end up being finished. </detail>

                COMP 426 Game Design Project <br>
            </project>
            <detail>This project is similar to the first one,  but it was done for my 2D game design class. It was written in Go and a game where ther player goes up and down and can shoot one projectile to destroy incoming enemies. However I did not fully complete the project. i found it much harder in Go and the standards were much higher.<br> <br><br></detail>
            <project> Final Project idea <br></project>
            <detail> What if for the final project, we had to create a fake product and make a webpage for it. I think it would be kind of fun creating reasons for why someone should buy a product, whether its practical or just a funny idea. We could also create an image of what the product would look like too perhaps(I do not know if that is too hard)?</detail>
