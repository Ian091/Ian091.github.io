    <hi> Welcome to my first webpage!
        <p>I am Ian Chartier, a senior in computer science at BSU. One of my favorite courses I have taken here was Robotics with Dr. Santore. I have two pets,
            Pepper and Pedro who are both cats.Their pictures are down below. I also love playing video games. I am currently obsessed with playing Final Fantasy 7 
            and Resident Evil 2. I also really like watching football. My favorite team has been the Steelers since I was a kid due to the simple fact that I like their colors and their emblem.
